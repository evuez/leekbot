# Leekbot

A Telegram bot written in Elixir.

This is my first Elixir application so things are quite messy, hopefully it'll get better as I learn more about Elixir.

For now the bot only replies to the following commands:

```
/kana <syllable> # Ask for the kana (hiragana only)
/cast <movie / tv show> # Ask for the cast of a movie / TV show
```

Start it in a iex session using `Leekbot.start_link`.

I don't have any explanation for the name. It just popped into my head when I started the project.
